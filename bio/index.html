    <h3> Short Biography </h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Quito, Ecuador and from early on in my life, I had a passion for nature. From collecting pets of every kind to sharing my appreciation for a gigantic beetle with an unwilling cousin, it has been impossible to keep me from the great outdoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending many field trips and summers traipsing through the jungles and mountains of Ecuador as well as the breathtaking Gal√°pagos Islands, I graduated from San Francisco de Quito University with a Bachelor's degree in Biology in 2014. After spending another year there working in a research lab, I came to United States to puruse a Master's degree in Environmnetal Science and Management at the Bren Schoool at UC Santa Barbara.

      While at UC Santa Barbara, I acclimated to the new, yet still appealing scenery of coastal California. While completing challenging and engaging courswork, my amazing team members and I completed our thesis project of developing a web app to assist communities in Mexico in determining the efficacy of their marine reserves, along with a guide book to aid them in using it.

      After graduating from UCSB in 2017, I moved to the Phoenix area to start my professional life in the Sonoran Desert. Since November 2017, I have worked with the Central Arizona Conservation Alliance and the Desert Botanical Garden to develop strategies to get the local population more aware of invasive species present in their communities.
    <h3> Personal Interests </h3>
    <p> 
      When I'm not working at the Desert Botanical Garden, I enjoy walking along the Green Belt in Scottsdale where I can hear the strange pig-like noises of the Neotropic Cormorants that haunt the local trees.

      International travel is also an occasional treat, and I have enjoyed living in Ecuador, France, and the United States (so far!). I enjoy salsa dancing and keeping up with Latin music. I adore chocolate of any kind and in any form, and I couldn't live without coffee. When I get some time, I love to read a good novel, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm an aspiring painter and gardener, and one day I'd like to start writing children's literature about nature.
